A simple Play 2.4 app with ReactiveMongo and Bootstrap
=======================================================

Author: Thomas Molenaar (tlmolenaar@hotmail.com)

-Play 2.4
-ReactiveMongo 0.11.14
-Bootstrap 3

What?
-------------------------------------

This is a simple app built with the Play framework consisting of a form where a user can enter his/her name and email.
The input is then saved to a MongoDB database via ReactiveMongo and shown in a list on the index page.

Every process is logged via the native Play logger which has been extended to show additional output as well as an
additional Medical Diagnostic Context thread local which provides information about what method a user is in.


How?
-------------------------------------

Most of the code is based on the documentation for the Play Framework and the ReactiveMongo driver.
In addition several secondary sources were used to gain a better understanding some of the features of Play (see below)

The process of building the app can be traced via the different commits to the Github repository.

Bootstrap was used to provide basic styling.


What's next?
-------------------------------------

The app is a work in progress and more features will be added in the future such as:

- Further CRUD functionality
- Automated tests
- Search function
